    "This project features data regarding death by pneumonia, collected from the CDC [here](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Provisional-Death-Counts-for-Influenza-Pneumonia-a/ynw2-4viq). Pneumonia is a pathology that includes the inflammation of the lung. Diseases that cause pneumonia, such as influenza and Covid-19, have come into the spotlight recently with the emergence of the pandemic.\n",

    "The Covid-19 pandemic has become a huge public health issue in the United States ever since being identified in Wuhan, China in 2019. As of the time of this project's submission, there have been over 50 million cases and 763,000 deaths in the US alone. This has been in part due to the fact that it is a novel virus, poor management strategies, and the pandemic of disinformation surrounding Covid-19 vaccines. In a NSF-REU program at the University of Chattanooga, Tennessee back in 2020, I used different data from Apple and Google mobility scores as a proxy for social distancing. I correlated this with R_0, the reproductive number of the virus, and temperature. You can see that visualization [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJlsJsTr03s). I think that the data is very interesting and am excited to work with it in a new way, especially after the pandemic has progressed for over a year and a half now. \n",

However, one thing I would have liked to see in the CDC data is a higher stratification of age groups. The middle age class, 18 to 64 years, spans 46 years of life and obviously a 64-year-old is going to have different health outcomes and prognoses than a 19-year-old despite still being in the same age category in this dataset.\n",
